Gnome Panel provides panels and default applets for the desktop.
A panel is a horizontal or vertical bar that can be added to each side of the
screen. By default there is one panel on the top of the screen and one on the
bottom, but this is configurable. The panels are used to add applets such as
a menu bar to open applications, a clock and indicator applets which provide
access to configure features of the system such as the network, sound or the
current keyboard layout. On the bottom panel there is usually a list of open
applications.
Default Applets:
  The Workspace Switcher
  The Window List
  The Window Selector
  The Notification Area
  The Clock
  The infamous 'Wanda the Fish'.
